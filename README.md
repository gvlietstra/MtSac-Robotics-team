# MtSac-Robotics-team
The is a repository that constants information that would be useful to new members, as well as useful reference material. 

There are many basic principles of engineering that robotics teaches students. This GitHib page will hopefully give you a head start on understanding as well as 
teach you the fundamentals. If you have any questions or issues please reach out to the senior members of the club or you are welcome to post an issue here.

There are three major roles in each of our robotics teams

-builder:
These members are responsible for the actual structure of the robot. Responsibilities of this role is relatively large and includes pencil and sketch design, cad work, assembly of bot, and quick repair of boat competition.

-programer: 
These members are responsible for taking the bot and making it actually move in a repeatable and predictable manner. This ranges from setting timers to wait and execute 
specific actions to putting on a myriad of sensors so that the bot knows exactly where it is at any point and time.

-team captain:
the role of the team captain is to facilitate the team making sure that everyone has a voice in the direction of the bot. " in this role you will have to talk to all the team members and make decisions for the team so there is a focused direction but the project is not yours alone.enlightened trial and error succeeds over the planning of the lone genius" -IDEO.

For surther information on these roles please look into each of there indavidual files in the main folder.
